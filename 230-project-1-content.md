The Horrors of Nazarick is a roguelike dungeon crawler that uses RNG for anything from enemy stats to hit/crit chance.


The game will be made in an 8-bit fashion, with sound effects caused by various events such as: attacking, taking damage, moving, and proceeding to the next level.

After a short, skippable tutorial, the player is dropped into the Great Tomb of Nazarick's catacombs, the first floor. Although the game is designed to be fairly linear, there's no harm in including a tutorial the player can choose to ignore.
